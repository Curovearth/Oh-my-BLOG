        <p><em>A heartfelt appreciation to <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/"> Yuval Noah Harari </a> for writing such a captivating and eye-opening book, <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/homo-deus/">HomoDeus</a>.</em></p>
        <p><strong>The Great Decoupling</strong></p>
        <p>Over the last decades there has been an immense advance in computer intelligence, but there has been exactly <strong>zero advance in computer consciousness.</strong></p>

        <h2 id="the-useless-class">The Useless Class</h2>
        <p>In the 1980s when people discussed the unique nature of humanity, they habitually used chess as primary proof of human superiority. They believed that computers would never beat humans at chess.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>On 10 February 1996, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov">IBM's Deep Blue</a> defeated world chess champion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a>, laying to rest that particular claim for <em>human pre-eminence</em>. Deep Blue's architects gave it a head start by preprogramming it with not only the basic principles of chess, but also thorough guidance on chess strategy. </li>
          <li>A new generation of AI uses machine learning to do even more remarkable and elegant things. In February 2015 a program developed by Google DeepMind learned by itself how to play forty-nine classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Games">Atari games</a>. One of the developers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demis_Hassabis">Dr Demis Hassabis</a>, explained that <em>‘the only information we gave the system was the raw pixels on the screen and the idea that it had to get a high score. And everything else it had to figure out by itself.’</em> The program managed to learn the rules of all the games it was presented with, from Pac-Man and Space Invaders to car racing and tennis games. It then played most of them as well as or better than humans, sometimes coming up with strategies that never occur to human players.</li>
          <li>In 2002 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Beane">Billy Beane</a>, the manager of the low-budget Oakland Athletics, decided to beat the system. He relied on an arcane computer algorithm developed by economists and computer geeks to create a winning team from players that human scouts overlooked or undervalued. The old-timers were incensed by Beane’s algorithm transgressing into the hallowed halls of baseball. They said that picking baseball players is an art, and that only humans with an intimate and long-standing experience of the game can master it. A computer program could never do it, because it could never decipher the secrets and the spirit of baseball. They soon had to eat their baseball caps. Beane’s shoestring-budget algorithmic team ($44 million) not only held its own against baseball giants such as the New York Yankees ($125 million), but became the first team ever in American League baseball to win twenty consecutive games. Not that Beane and Oakland could enjoy their success for long. Soon enough, many other baseball teams adopted the same algorithmic approach, and since the Yankees and Red Sox could pay far more for both baseball players and computer software, low-budget teams such as the Oakland Athletics now had an even smaller chance of beating the system than before.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Murnane">Professor Richard Murnane</a> from Harvard published a thorough research of the job market, listing those <strong>professions most likely to undergo automation</strong>. Truck drivers were given as an example of a job that could not possibly be automated in the foreseeable future. It is hard to imagine, they wrote, that algorithms could safely drive trucks on a busy road. A mere ten years later, Google and Tesla not only imagine this, but are actually making it happen.</p>
        <p>In May 2014 <a href="https://www.dkv.global/">Deep Knowledge Ventures</a> – a Hong Kong venture-capital firm specialising in <strong>regenerative medicine</strong> – broke new ground by appointing an algorithm called VITAL to its board. VITAL makes investment recommendations by analysing huge amounts of data on the financial situation, clinical trials and intellectual property of prospective companies. Like the other five board members, the algorithm gets to vote on whether the firm makes an investment in a specific company or not.</p>
        <p><center><small> Examining VITAL’s record so far, it seems that it has already picked up one managerial vice: <strong>nepotism.</strong></small></center></p>
        <p> It has recommended investing in companies that grant algorithms more authority. With VITAL’s blessing, Deep Knowledge Ventures has recently invested in Silico Medicine, which develops computerassisted methods for drug research, and in Pathway Pharmaceuticals, which employs a platform called <a href="https://www.oncofinder.com/">OncoFinder</a> to select and rate personalised cancer therapies.</p>
        <p><strong>If gods can possess land and employ people, why not algorithms?</strong></p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cope">David Cope</a> is a musicology professor at the University of California in Santa Cruz. He is also one of the more controversial figures in the world of classical music. Cope has written programs that compose concertos, chorales, symphonies and operas. His first creation was named <a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/experiments.htm">EMI (Experiments in Musical Intelligence)</a>, which specialised in imitating the style of Johann Sebastian Bach. After seven years of programming EMI was capable to compose 5000 chorales à la Bach in a single day. At a music festival, Cope arranged a performance of a few chorales at which the audience praised the performance so much that they explained how it touched their innermost being. When the truth was revealed that it was composed by EMI and not Bach, some became very furious, while others sat in silence. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2OlkKUlMYbxzjzYS0ZMo34?si=d70ef326ecf2474f">[Spotify Playlist]</a></p>

        <p>In September 2013 two Oxford researchers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Benedikt_Frey<">Carl Benedikt Frey</a> and <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mosb/">Michael A. Osborne</a>, published <strong>‘The Future of Employment’</strong>, in which they surveyed the <strong>likelihood of different professions being taken over by computer algorithms</strong> within the next twenty years.</p>

        <p><em><center>Some experts and thinkers, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom">Nick Bostrom</a>, warn that humankind is unlikely to suffer this degradation, because once artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, it might simply exterminate humankind.</center></em></p>

        <p>In 2000 the Israeli singer Shlomi Shavan conquered the local playlists with his hit song ‘Arik’. It’s about a guy who is obsessed with his girlfriend’s ex, Arik. He demands to know who is better in bed – him, or Arik? The girlfriend dodges the question, saying that it was different with each of them. The guy is not satisfied and demands: ‘Talk numbers, lady.’ Well, precisely for such guys, a company called <a href="https://www.the-bedpost.co.uk/">Bedpost sells biometric armbands</a> you can wear while having sex. The armband collects data such as heart rate, sweat level, duration of sexual intercourse, duration of orgasm and the number of calories you burnt. The data is fed into a computer that analyses the information and ranks your performance with precise numbers.</p>

        <h2 id="upgrading-inequality">Upgrading Inequality</h2>
        <p>So far we have looked at two of the three practical threats to liberalism:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Firstly, that humans will lose their value completely;</li> 
          <li>Secondly, that humans will still be valuable collectively, but they will lose their individual authority, and will instead be managed by external algorithms.</li>
          <li>The third threat to liberalism is that some people will remain both indispensable and undecipherable, but they will constitute a small and privileged elite of upgraded humans.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The Ocean of Consciousness</strong></p>
        <h2 id="gap-the-mind">Gap the Mind</h2>
        <p>However, most scientific research about the human mind and the human experience has been conducted on people from <strong>Western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic (WEIRD) societies</strong>, who do not constitute a representative sample of humanity.</p>
        <p>Bats, for example, experience the world through echolocation. They emit a very rapid stream of high-frequency calls, well beyond the range of the human ear. They then detect and interpret the returning echoes to build a picture of the world. That picture is so detailed and accurate that the bats can fly quickly between trees and buildings, chase and capture moths and mosquitoes, and all the time evade owls and other predators.</p>
        <p>Whales can hear one another from hundreds of kilometres away, and each whale has a repertoire of characteristic ‘songs’ that may last for hours and follow very intricate patterns.</p>
        <p>Another sea creature, octopus exhibits much more complex behaviour. The octopus eats clams, crabs, and fish.The octopus eats clams, crabs, and fish. Each of the prey types requires a different hunting behavior: for example, clams must be removed from their shells, and this is not an easy task! The octopus drills a hole in the shell and injects venom to paralyze and relax the clam’s muscles, so it can be pulled out. Another example of complex behavior is that octopi can learn from observing other octopi. For example, from watching another octopus open a jar of food by unscrewing the lid, the observing octopus also learns to do so. <a href="https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2021.752743">[source]</a></p>

        <h2 id="the-nail-universe-hangs">The Nail on which the Universe Hangs</h2>
        <p>When the nail on which the entire universe hangs is pegged in a problematic spot, technology would pull it out and stick it somewhere else. The most interesting emerging religion is <strong>Dataism</strong>, which venerates neither gods nor man – <strong>it worships data</strong>.</p>
