        <title> The New Human Agenda </title>

        <p><em>A heartfelt appreciation to <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/"> Yuval Noah Harari </a> for writing such a captivating and eye-opening book, <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/homo-deus/">HomoDeus</a>.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Famine, Plague</strong> and <strong>War</strong> had been the same three problems which preoccupied the people of twentieth-century China, of medieval India and of ancient Egypt.</p>
        <p>For the first time in history, more people die today from <em>eating too much</em> than from eating too little; more people <em>die from old age</em> than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined.</p>
        
        <h2 id="biological-poverty-line"> Biological Poverty Line </h2>
        <p>Mass Famines still strike some areas from time to time, but they are exceptional, and they are almost always caused by human politics rather than by natural catastrophes.</p> 
        <center><q>There are no longer natural famines in the world, there are only <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/j5Ooz71LDtk">Political Famines</a></strong></q></center>
        <br>
        <p>Alongside such epidemical tsunamis that struck humankind every few decades, people also faced smaller but more regular waves of infectious diseases, which killed millions every year. Children who lacked immunity were particularly susceptible to them, hence they are often called 'childhood diseases'. Until the early twentieth century, about a third of children died before reaching adulthood from a combination of malnutrition and disease. During the last century humankind became ever more vulnerable to epidemics, due to a combination of growing populations and better transport. No one can guarantee that plagues won’t make a comeback, but there are good reasons to think that <em>in the arms race between doctors and germs, doctors run faster.</em></p>
        <p>Today such mutations probably occur and disseminate faster than in the past, due to human impact on the environment. Some research labs are already home to <a href="https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/news/iisc-nanobots-root-canal-treatments/">nano-robots</a> and effective drugs, that may one day navigate through our bloodstream, identify illnesses and kill pathogens and <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/first-time-in-history-cancer-vanishes-for-every-patient-in-drug-trial-3044922">cancerous cells</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="breaking-the-law-of-the-jungle"> Breaking the Law of the Jungle </h2>
        <p>In 2012 about 56 million people died throughout the world; 620,000 of them died due to human violence (war killed 120,000 people, and crime killed another 500,000). In contrast, 800,000 committed suicide, and 1.5 million died of diabetes.</p> 
        <center><p><small>“Sugar is now more dangerous than gunpowder”</small></p></center>
        <p>Over the last seventy years humankind has broken not only <a href="https://ginifoundation.org/kb/law-of-jungle/">the Law of the Jungle</a>, but also the Chekhov Law.</p>
        <blockquote><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov">Anton Chekhov</a> famously said that a gun appearing in the first act of a play will inevitably be fired in the third.</strong></blockquote>
        <p>Throughout history, if kings and emperors acquired some new weapon, sooner or later they were tempted to use it. Since 1945, however, humankind has learned to resist this temptation. The gun that appeared in the first act of the Cold War was never fired. By now we are accustomed to living in a world full of undropped bombs and unlaunched missiles, and have become experts in breaking both the Law of the Jungle and the Chekhov Law. If these laws ever do catch up with us, it will be our own fault – not our inescapable destiny</p>
        <p>The <em>overreaction to terrorism</em> poses a far greater threat to our society than the terrorists themselves. Terrorists are like a fly that tries to destroy a china shop. The fly is so weak that it cannot budge even a single teacup. So, it finds a bull, gets inside its ear and starts buzzing. The bull goes wild with fear and anger, and destroys the china shop. Similarly, terrorist organizations provoke their targets into deploying massive countermeasures, ultimately allowing terrorists to mobilize a greater share of their audience.</p>
        <p>Given our twentieth-century accomplishments, if people continue to suffer from famine, plague and war, we cannot blame it on nature or on God. It is within our power to make things better and to reduce the incidence of suffering even further.</p>

        <blockquote><strong>“History does not tolerate a vacuum”.</strong><br> If incidences of famine, plague and war are decreasing, something is bound to take their place on the human agenda.</blockquote><br>
        <p>Humans are rarely satisfied with what they already have. The most common reaction of the human mind to achievement is not satisfaction, but <em>craving for more</em>. Humans are always on the lookout for something better, bigger, tastier. <strong>Success breeds ambition</strong>, and our recent achievements are now pushing humankind to set itself even more daring goals.</p>
        <center><p>Humanity's next targets are likely to be be <strong>immortality, happiness</strong> and <strong>divinity</strong>.</p></center>

        <h2 id="the-last-days-of-death">The Last days of Death</h2>
        <blockquote>The <strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</strong> adopted by the UN after the Second World War – which is perhaps the closest thing we have to a global constitution – categorically states that <strong>'The Right to Life'</strong> is humanity’s most fundamental value.</blockquote> 
        <p>Since death clearly violates this right, <strong>death is a crime against humanity</strong>, and we ought to wage total war against it. In reality, however, humans don’t die because a figure in a black cloak taps them on the shoulder, or because God decreed it, or because mortality is an essential part of some great cosmic plan. Humans always die due to some technical glitch.</p>
        <center><small><p>"Equality is out, Immortality is in"</p></small></center>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey">Aubrey de Grey</a> are even more sanguine. They maintain that anyone possessing a healthy body and a healthy bank account in 2050 will have a serious shot at immortality by cheating death a decade at a time. According to Kurzweil and de Grey, every ten years or so we will march into the clinic and receive a makeover treatment that will not only cure illnesses, but will also regenerate decaying tissues, and upgrade hands, eyes and brains. Before the next treatment is due, doctors will have invented a plethora of new medicines, upgrades and gadgets.</p>
        <p>The physicist <q><strong>Max Planck famously said that science advances one funeral at a time.</strong></q> He meant that only when one generation passes away do new theories have a chance to root out old ones.</p>

        <h2 id="the-right-to-happiness">The Right to Happiness</h2>
        <p>In ancient Greece the philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus">Epicurus</a> explained that <em>worshipping gods is a waste of time</em>, that <em>there is no existence after death</em>, and that <strong>happiness is the sole purpose of life</strong>. Most people in ancient times rejected Epicureanism, but today it has become the default view. Scepticism about the afterlife drives humankind to seek not only immortality, but also earthly happiness. For who would like to live for ever in eternal misery?</p>
        <p>On the biological level, both our expectations and our happiness are determined by our biochemistry, rather than by our economic, social or political situation.</p>
        <p>In the twentieth century per capita GDP was perhaps the supreme yardstick for evaluating national success. <em>But nowadays thinkers, politicians and even economists are calling to supplement or even replace GDP with GDH</em> – <strong>Gross Domestic Happiness</strong>. After all, what do people want? They don’t want to produce. They want to be happy.</p>

        <br>
        <p>A thousand things may make us angry, but anger is never an abstraction. It is always felt as a <em>sensation of heat</em> and <em>tension in the body</em>, which is what makes anger so infuriating. Not for nothing do we say that we ‘burn’ with anger.</p>
        <p>You may debate whether it is good or bad, but it seems that the second great project of the twenty-first century – <strong>to ensure global happiness</strong> – will involve re-engineering Homo sapiens so that it can enjoy everlasting pleasure.</p>

        <h2 id="the-gods-of-planet-earth">The Gods of Planet Earth</h2>
        <p>In the twenty-first century, the third big project of humankind will be <strong>to acquire for us divine powers of creation and destruction, and upgrade Homo sapiens into Homo deus</strong>. This third project obviously subsumes the first two projects, and is fuelled by them. We want the ability to <em>reengineer our bodies</em> and minds in order, above all, to escape old age, death and misery, but once we have it, who knows what else we might do with such ability? So we may well think of the new human agenda as consisting really of only one project (with many branches): attaining divinity.</p>

        <p>Mutations are a ubiquitous risk. All people carry in their DNA some harmful mutations and less-than-optimal alleles. Sexual reproduction is a lottery. <br>A famous – and probably apocryphal – anecdote tells of a meeting in 1923 between Nobel Prize laureate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatole_France">Anatole France</a> and the beautiful and talented dancer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isadora_Duncan">Isadora Duncan</a>. Discussing the then popular <strong>Eugenics movement</strong>, Duncan said, ‘Just imagine a child with my beauty and your brains!’ France responded, ‘Yes, but imagine a child with my beauty and your brains.'</p>
        <blockquote><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/germany/eugenics#:~:text=Eugenics%20is%20the%20practice%20or,characteristics%20from%20the%20human%20population.">Eugenics Movement:</a> the practice or advocacy of improving the human species by selectively mating people with specific desirable hereditary traits. </blockquote>

        <h2 id="the-paradox-of-knowledge">The Paradox of Knowledge</h2>
        <p>Knowledge that does not change behaviour is useless. But knowledge that changes behaviour quickly loses its relevance. The more data we have and the better we understand history, the faster history alters its course, and the faster our knowledge becomes outdated.</p>
        
        <h2 id="a-brief-history-of-lawns">A brief History of Lawns</h2>
        <p>Movements seeking to change the world often begin by <strong>rewriting history</strong>, thereby enabling people to <strong>reimagine the future</strong>. Whether you want workers to go on a general strike, women to take possession of their bodies, or oppressed minorities to demand political rights – the first step is to retell their history. The new history will explain that</p> 
        <blockquote><strong>'Our present situation is neither natural nor eternal. Things were different once. Only a string of chance events created the unjust world we know today. If we act wisely, we can change that world, and create a much better one.'</strong></blockquote>
        <p>This best reason to learn history: not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies. Of course this is not total freedom – we cannot avoid being shaped by the past. But <em>some freedom is better than none</em>.</p>

        <h2 id="a-gun-in-act1">A Gun in Act1</h2>
        <p>For 300 years the world has been dominated by humanism, which sanctifies the life, happiness and power of Homo sapiens.</p>
        <center><strong>People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.</strong></center>
