        <title> Homo Sapiens giving meaning to the world </title>

        <p><em>A heartfelt appreciation to <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/"> Yuval Noah Harari </a> for writing such a captivating and eye-opening book, <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/homo-deus/">HomoDeus</a>.</em></p>
        <p><strong>The Storytellers</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Homo Sapiens</strong> ('wise man') or modern humans, are the only species of human still around today. They are the most abundant and widespread species of primate, characterized by bipedalism and large, complex brains. Curiosity and the human desire to understand and influence the environment and to explain and manipulate phenomena have motivated humanity's development of science, philosophy, mythology, religion and other fields of study.</p>
        <center><p><em>Homo sapiens</em> is an obsolete algorithm. After all, what's the <em>advantage of humans over chickens?</em></p></center>

        <h2 id="but-it-works">But it Works!</h2>
        <center><q><em>History isn’t a single narrative, but thousands of alternative narratives. Whenever we choose to tell one, we are also choosing to silence others.</em></q></center>
        <br>
        <p>For example, belief in national and religious myths might cause the outbreak of war, in which millions lose their homes, their limbs and even their lives. The cause of war is fictional, but the suffering is 100 per cent real. This is exactly why we should strive to distinguish fiction from reality.</p>

        <h2 id="the-odd-couple">The Odd Couple and Holy Dogma</h2>
        <p>Stories serve as the foundations and pillars of human societies. As history unfolded, stories about gods, nations and corporations grew so powerful that they began to dominate objective reality. Unfortunately, blind faith in these stories meant that human efforts frequently focused on increasing the glory of fictional entitites such as gods and nations, instead of bettering the lives of real sentinent beings.</p>
        <p>Most peer-reviewed scientific studies agree that the Bible is a collection of numerous different texts composed by different people in different times, and that these texts were not assembled into a single holy book until long after biblical times.</p>
        <p>Philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Harris">Sam Harris</a> thinks all humans share a single supreme value – minimising suffering and maximising happiness – and all ethical debates are factual arguments concerning the most efficient way to maximise happiness</p>

        <p><strong>The Modern Covenant</strong></p>
        <p>If we invest money in research, then scientific breakthroughs will accelerate technological progress. New technologies will fuel economic growth, and a growing economy could dedicate even more money to research.</p>

        <h2 id="miracle-pie">The Miracle Pie</h2>
        <p>Modern politicians and economists insist that growth is vital for three principal reasons.</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Firstly, when we produce more, we can consume more, raise our standard of living and allegedly enjoy a happier life.</li> 
          <li>Secondly, as long as humankind multiplies, economic growth is needed merely to stay where we are. For example, in India the annual population growth rate is 1.2 per cent. That means that unless the Indian economy grows each year by at least 1.2 per cent, unemployment will rise, salaries will fall and the average standard of living will decline.</li> 
          <li>Thirdly, even if Indians stop multiplying, and even if the Indian middle class can be satisfied with its present standard of living, what should India do about its hundreds of millions of poverty-stricken citizens? If the economy doesn’t grow, and the pie therefore remains the same size, you can give more to the poor only by taking something from the rich.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That will force you to make some very hard choices, and will probably cause a lot of resentment and even violence. If you wish to avoid hard choices, resentment and violence, you need a bigger pie.</p>
        <p>Economic growth has thus become the crucial juncture where almost all modern religions, ideologies and movements meet.</p>

        <h2 id="the-ark-syndrome">The Ark Syndrome</h2>
        <p>Yet can the economy actually keep growing for ever? Won’t it eventually run out of resources – and grind to a halt? In order to ensure perpetual growth, we must somehow discover an inexhaustible store of resources.</p>
        <p>It is science that has provided modernity with the solution. The fox economy cannot grow, because foxes don’t know how to produce more rabbits. The rabbit economy stagnates, because rabbits cannot make the grass grow faster. But the human economy can grow because humans can discover new materials and sources of energy. But in truth, there are three kinds of resources: raw materials, energy and knowledge.</p>
        <p><strong>The greatest scientific discovery was the discovery of ignorance.</strong> Once humans realised how little they knew about the world, they suddenly had a very good reason to seek new knowledge, which opened up the scientific road to progress. If previously it was enough to invent something amazing once a century, today we need to come up with a miracle every two years.</p>

        <p><strong>The Humanist Revolution</strong></p>
        <p>The modern deal offers us power, on condition that we renounce our belief in a great cosmic plan that gives meaning to life. As of 2016, humankind indeed manages to hold the stick at both ends. Not only do we possess far more power than ever before, but against all expectations.</p> 
        <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*0RTkYjLuOmWsu91etzBRoQ.jpeg"></p>
        <p><strong>God's death did not lead to social collapse.</strong> Throughout history prophets and philosophers have argued that if humans stopped believing in a great cosmic plan, all law and order would vanish. Yet today, those who pose the greatest threat to global law and order are precisely those people who continue to believe in God and his all-encompassing plans.</p>
        <h2 id="look-inside">Look Inside</h2>
        <p>This is the primary commandment humanism has given us: <strong>create meaning for a meaningless world.</strong> It is good to know what Aristotle, Solomon and Aquinas thought about politics, art and economics; yet since the supreme source of meaning and authority lies within ourselves, it is far more important to know what you think about these matters.</p>
        <p>Either way, the real source of authority is my own feelings. So even while saying that <center><q>I believe in God, the truth is I have a much stronger belief in my own inner voice.</q></center></p>

        <h2 id="follow-the-yellow-brick-road">Follow the Yellow Brick Road</h2>
        <p>In medieval Europe, the chief formula for knowledge was: <strong>Knowledge = Scriptures x Logic.</strong> </p> 
        <p>We want to know the answer to some important question, we should read scriptures, and use our logic to understand the exact meaning of the text.</p>
        <p>The Scientific Revolution proposed a very different formula for knowledge: <strong>Knowledge = Empirical Data x Mathematics</strong>. If we want to know the answer to some question, we need to gather relevant empirical data, and then use mathematical tools to analyse the data.</p>
        <p>As humans gained confidence in themselves, a new formula for attaining ethical knowledge appeared: <strong>Knowledge = Experiences x Sensitivity</strong>.</p>
        <p>The highest aim of humanist life is to fully develop your knowledge through a large variety of intellectual, emotional and physical experiences.</p>

        <h2 id="humanist-schism">The Humanist Schism and Is Beethoven better than Chuck Berry?</h2>
        <blockquote><strong>Schism:</strong> is a division between people, usually belonging to an organization, movement or religious denomination.</blockquote>
        <p>Global peace will be achieved not by celebrating the distinctiveness of each nation, but by <em>unifying all the workers of the world</em>; and social harmony won’t be achieved by <em>each person narcissistically exploring their own inner depths</em>, but rather by <em>each person prioritising the needs and experiences of others over their own desires.</em></p>
        <p>The experience of war revealed to Hitler the truth about the world: <strong>it is a jungle run by the remorseless laws of natural selection</strong>. Those who refuse to recognise this truth cannot survive. If you wish to succeed, you must not only understand the laws of the jungle, but embrace them joyfully. It should be stressed that just like the anti-war liberal artists, Hitler too sanctified the experience of ordinary soldiers.</p>

        <p>Evolutionary humanism played an important part in the shaping of modern culture, and it is likely to play an even greater role in the shaping of the twenty-first century.</p>
        <p>According to evolutionary humanists, anyone arguing that all human experiences are equally valuable is either an imbecile or a coward. Such vulgarity and timidity will lead only to the degeneration and extinction of humankind, as human progress is impeded in the name of cultural relativism or social equality.</p>

        <h2 id="electricity-genetics">Electricity, Genetics and Radical Islam</h2>
        <p>In India, <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=6bd3fb5580a1fea775d8aad0a502ed28931acda427b6b80f1fc416488647e3d2JmltdHM9MTY1NDkyMTY0MCZpZ3VpZD1jYzEyZTZiNi0yNjA4LTRlZjEtYWM1ZC00N2U0NmYxYjNjYjYmaW5zaWQ9NTIwMA&ptn=3&fclid=c82c3e75-e93e-11ec-9668-e8bd27a48283&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvRGF5YW5hbmRhX1NhcmFzd2F0aQ&ntb=1">Dayananda Saraswati</a> headed a Hindu revival movement, whose basic principle was that the Vedic scriptures are never wrong. In 1875 he founded the <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=8f42e92e3dc877154c9a1e722ea4a70edf762914ace30c7eb99a9677fb1bc35fJmltdHM9MTY1NDkyMTY4MyZpZ3VpZD1kYjkxMWE3My0zYTA4LTQ4OTUtOWI0Ny00YzJjODkwMzk5MzEmaW5zaWQ9NTIxMQ&ptn=3&fclid=e1bd8438-e93e-11ec-99bd-9e1a06d6ce9a&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQXJ5YV9TYW1hag&ntb=1">Arya Samaj</a> (Noble Society), dedicated to the spreading of Vedic knowledge – though truth be told, Dayananda often interpreted the Vedas in a surprisingly liberal way, supporting for example <strong>equal rights for women long before the idea became popular in the West</strong>.</p>
        <p>The main products of the twenty-first century will be <em>bodies, brains</em> and <em>minds</em>, and the gap between those who know how to engineer bodies and brains and those who do not will be far bigger than the gap between Dickens’s Britain and the Mahdi’s Sudan.</p>
        <p>Now ask yourself: what was the most influential discovery, invention or creation of traditional religions such as Islam and Christianity in the twentieth century? This too is a very difficult question, because there is so little to choose from. What did priests, rabbis and muftis discover in the twentieth century that can be mentioned in the same breath as antibiotics, computers or feminism?</p>
        <p>Billions of people, including many scientists, continue to use religious scriptures as a source of authority, but these texts are no longer a source of creativity. Think, for example, about the acceptance of gay marriage or female clergy by the more progressive branches of Christianity. Where did this acceptance originate? Not from reading the Bible, St Augustine or Martin Luther. Rather, it came fromreading texts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Sexuality">Michel Foucault’s The History of Sexuality</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Cyborg_Manifesto">Donna Haraway’s ‘A Cyborg Manifesto’</a>. Yet Christian true-believers – however progressive – cannot admit to drawing their ethics from Foucault and Haraway. So they go back to the Bible, to St Augustine and to Martin Luther, and make a very thorough search. They read page after page and story after story with the utmost attention, until they find what they need: some maxim, parable or ruling that if interpreted creatively enough means that God blesses gay marriages and that women can be ordained to the priesthood. They then pretend the idea originated in the Bible, when in fact it originated with F</p>
        <p>When genetic engineering and artificial intelligence reveal their full potential, liberalism, democracy and free markets might become as obsolete as flint knives, tape cassettes, Islam and communism.</p>
