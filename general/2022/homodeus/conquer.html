        <title> Homo Sapiens conquers the world </title>

        <p><em>A heartfelt appreciation to <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/"> Yuval Noah Harari </a> for writing such a captivating and eye-opening book, <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/homo-deus/">HomoDeus</a>.</em></p>
        <p><strong>The Anthropocene</strong></p>
        <p>Scientists divide the history of our planet into epochs such as the Pleistocene, the Pliocene and the Miocene. Officially, we live in the Holocene epoch. Yet it may be better to call the last 70,000 years the Anthropocene epoch: the epoch of humanity.</p>
        <p>Mass extinctions occur once every many millions of years. Yes, a big asteroid will probably hit our planet sometime in the next 100 million years, but it is very unlikely to happen next Tuesday. Instead of fearing asteroids, <strong>we should fear ourselves</strong>.</p>
        <center><em>"Humanity has greatly influenced the Holocene environment; while all organisms influence their environments to some degree, few have ever changed the globe as much, or as fast, as our species is doing. The vast majority of scientists agree that human activity is responsible for "global warming," an observed increase in mean global temperatures that is still going on. Habitat destruction, pollution, and other factors are causing an ongoing mass extinction of plant and animal species; according to some projections, 20% of all plant and animal species on Earth will be extinct within the next 25 years."</em> ~ <a href="https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/quaternary/holocene.php#:~:text=The%20Holocene%20is%20the%20name,the%20Holocene%20has%20been%20a">source</a></center>

        <h2 id="organisms-are-algorithms">Organisms are Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Emotions are biochemical algorithms that are vital for the survival and reproduction of all mammals. The algorithms controlling humans work through sensations, emotions and thoughts. The dependency and the inter-process communication of entire body(OS) involves weird and complex algorithms.</p>
        <p>The word ‘mammal’ comes from the Latin mamma, meaning breast. Mammal mothers love their offspring so much that they allow them to suckle from their body. Mammal youngsters, on their side, feel an overwhelming desire to bond with their mothers and stay near them.</p>

        <h2 id="afraid-of-charles-darwin">Who's afraid of Charles Darwin?</h2>
        <p>According to a 2012 Gallup survey, </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only 15 per cent of Americans think that Homo sapiens evolved through natural selection alone, free of all divine intervention</li> 
          <li>32 per cent maintain that humans may have evolved from earlier life forms in a process lasting millions of years, but God orchestrated this entire show</li> 
          <li>46 per cent believe that God created humans in their current form sometime during the last 10,000 years, just as the Bible says.</li> 
        </ul>
        <p><center>Spending three years in college has absolutely no impact on these views.</center></p>
        <p>The same survey found that among BA graduates, <em>46 per cent believe in the biblical creation story</em>, whereas only <em>14 per cent think that humans evolved without any divine supervision</em>. Even among holders of MA and PhD degrees, <em>25 per cent believe the Bible, whereas only 29 per cent credit natural selection alone with the creation of our species</em>. </p>
        <p>The theory of relativity makes nobody angry, because it doesn’t contradict any of our cherished beliefs. Most people don’t care an iota whether space and time are absolute or relative. If you think it is possible to bend space and time, well, be my guest. Go ahead and bend them. What do I care? In contrast, Darwin has deprived us of our souls.<strong> If you really understand the theory of evolution, you understand that there is no soul.</strong></p>
        <p>That’s why the theory of evolution cannot accept the idea of souls, at least if by ‘soul’ we mean something indivisible, immutable and potentially eternal. Such an entity cannot possibly result from a step-by-step evolution.</p>
        <p><center><img src="../homodeus img/darwin.jpg" alt="darwin and corporate"/></center></p>
        <p>Hence the existence of souls cannot be squared with the theory of evolution.<strong> Evolution means change</strong>, and is incapable of producing everlasting entities. From an evolutionary perspective, the closest thing we have to a human essence is our DNA, and the DNA molecule is the vehicle of mutation rather than the seat of eternity.</p>

        <h2 id="why-the-stock-exchange-has-no-consciousness">Why the Stock Exchange has no Consciousness?</h2>
        <p>Mind is a flow of subjective experiences, such as pain, pleasure, anger and love. These mental experiences are made of interlinked sensations, emotions and thoughts, which flash for a brief moment, and immediately disappear.</p>
        <p>What exactly are the conscious experiences that constitute the flow of the mind? Every subjective experience has two fundamental characteristics: sensation and desire. Sensations and emotions are biochemical data-processing algorithms.</p>
        <center><p><small>We won’t be able to grasp the full implications of novel technologies such as artificial intelligence<br> if we don’t know what minds are.</small></p></center>
        <p>Current orthodoxy holds that consciousness is created by electrochemical reactions in the brain, and that mental experiences fulfil some essential data processing function.</p>

        <h2 id="the-equation-of-life">The Equation of Life and The Clever Horse</h2>
        <p>Subjective experiences are essential for our survival, because if we didn’t feel hunger or fear we would not have bothered to chase rabbits and flee lions.</p>
        <p>Humans nowadays completely dominate the planet not because the individual human is far smarter and more nimble-fingered than the individual chimp or wolf, but because Homo sapiens is the only species on earth capable of <strong>co-operating flexibly in large numbers</strong>. Intelligence and toolmaking were obviously very important as well. But if humans had not learned to cooperate flexibly in large numbers, our crafty brains and deft hands would still be splitting flint stones rather than uranium atoms.</p>

        <h2 id="the-web-of-meaning">The Web of Meaning and Dreamtime</h2>
        <p>People find it difficult to understand the idea of ‘imagined orders’ because they assume that there are only two types of realities: <strong>objective realities</strong> and <strong>subjective realities</strong>. In objective reality, things exist independently of our beliefs and feelings. Gravity, for example, is an objective reality. It existed long before Newton, and it affects people who don’t believe in it just as much as it affects those who do. Subjective reality, in contrast, depends on my personal beliefs and feelings.</p>

        <p><small><center>Interrelationship between various scientific models of human being</center></small></p>
        <p>Each round of mutual confirmation tightens the web of meaning further, until you have little choice but to believe what everyone else believes. People weave a web of meaning, believe in it with all their heart, but sooner or later the web unravels, and when we look back we cannot understand how anybody could have taken it seriously.</p>
        <center><p><strong>if we want to understand our future, cracking genomes and crunching numbers is hardly enough. We must also decipher the fictions that give meaning to the world.</strong></p></center>
