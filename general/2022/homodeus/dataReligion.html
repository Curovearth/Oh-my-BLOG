        <title> The data religion </title>

        <p><em>A heartfelt appreciation to <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/"> Yuval Noah Harari </a> for writing such a captivating and eye-opening book, <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/homo-deus/">HomoDeus</a>.</em></p>
        <p>Dataism says that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing. Dataism is most firmly entrenched in its two mother disciplines: computer science and biology.</p>

        <h2 id="power-gone">Where has All the Power Gone?</h2>
        <p><em>Dictatorships use <strong>centralised processing methods</strong></em>, whereas <em>democracies prefer <strong>distributed processing</strong>.</em></p>
        <p><center><img src="https://s39248.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3-13-17-NCPW-CARTOON.jpg" alt="technology control over politics"></center></p>
        <p>In the coming decades, it is likely that we will see more Internet-like revolutions, in which <q><strong>technology steals a march on politics</strong></q>. Artificial intelligence and biotechnology might soon overhaul our societies and economies – and our bodies and minds too – but they are hardly a blip on our political radar. If in the twenty-first century traditional political structures can no longer process the data fast enough to produce meaningful visions, then new and more efficient structures will evolve to take their place.</p>

        <h2 id="history-nutshell">History in a Nutshell</h2>
        <p>From a Dataist perspective, </p>
        <center><p>We may interpret the entire human species as a single data-processing system,<br> with individual humans serving as its chips.</p></center>
        <p> If so, we can also understand the whole of history as a process of improving the efficiency of this system, through four basic methods: </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Increasing the number of processors. A city of 100,000 people has more computing power than a village of 1,000 people.</li>
            <li>Increasing the variety of processors. Different processors may use diverse ways to calculate and analyse data. Using several kinds of processors in a single system may therefore increase its dynamism and creativity. A conversation between a peasant, a priest and a physician may produce novel ideas that would never emerge from a conversation between three hunter-gatherers. </li>
            <li>Increasing the number of connections between processors. There is little point in increasing the mere number and variety of processors if they are poorly connected to each other. A trade network linking ten cities is likely to result in many more economic, technological and social innovations than ten isolated cities. </li>
            <li>Increasing the freedom of movement along existing connections. Connecting processors is hardly useful if data cannot flow freely. Just building roads between ten cities won’t be very useful if they are plagued by robbers, or if some autocratic despot doesn’t allow merchants and travellers to move as they wish. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>These four methods often contradict one another. The greater the number and variety of processors, the harder it is to freely connect them. The construction of the Sapiens data-processing system accordingly passed through four main stages, each characterised by an emphasis on different methods.</p>
        <center><p><img src="https://dataethics.eu/wp-content/uploads/HumanAlgo.jpg" alt="dataism" ></p></center>
        <p><em>If humankind is indeed a single data-processing system, what is its output?</em></p>
        <p> Dataists would say that its output will be the creation of a new and even more efficient data-processing system, called the <strong>Internet-of-All-Things</strong>. Once this mission is accomplished, Homo sapiens will vanish.</p>

        <h2 id="information-free">Information wants to be Free</h2>
        <p><em>Homo sapiens is an obsolete algorithm.</em> After all, what’s the advantage of humans over chickens? Only that in humans information flows in much more complex patterns than in chickens. Humans absorb more data, and process it using better algorithms.</p>
        <center><p><strong>Freedom of information, in contrast, is not given to humans. It is given to information.</strong> Moreover, this novel value may impinge on the traditional freedom of expression,<br> by privileging the right of information to circulate freely over the right of humans to own data and to restrict its movement. </p></center>
        <p> 11 January 2013, Dataism got its first martyr when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>, a twenty-six-year-old American hacker, committed suicide in his apartment. Swartz was a rare genius.
            <ul>
            <li>At fourteen, he helped develop the crucial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS protocol</a>.</li>
            <li>He was also a <q>firm believer in the freedom of information</q>.</li> 
            <li>In 2008 he published the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerilla_Open_Access_Manifesto">'Guerilla Open Access Manifesto'</a> that demanded a <strong>free and unlimited flow of information</strong>. 
                <center>Swartz said that ‘We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that’s out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access.’</center></li> 
            <li>Swartz was as good as his word. He became annoyed with the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR digital library</a> for charging its customers. JSTOR holds millions of scientific papers and studies, and believes in the freedom of expression of scientists and journal editors, which includes the freedom to charge a fee for reading their articles. <br>According to JSTOR, if I want to get paid for the ideas I created, it’s my right to do so. Swartz thought otherwise. He believed that information wants to be free, that ideas don’t belong to the people who created them, and that it is wrong to lock data behind walls and charge money for entrance. He used the MIT computer network to access JSTOR, and downloaded hundreds of thousands of scientific papers, which he intended to release onto the Internet, so that everybody could read them freely.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Just as capitalists believe that all good things depend on economic growth, so Dataists believe all good things – including economic growth – depend on the freedom of information. 
            <center>
            <em>Why did the USA grow faster than the USSR?</em> Because <strong>information flowed more freely</strong> in the USA.
            <br><br><em>Why are Americans healthier, wealthier and happier than Iranians or Nigerians?</em><br> Thanks to the <strong>freedom of information.</strong> <br>
            </center></p>
        <p><center><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/0*nUdD22xEjD2sukHo" alt="aaron swartz"></center></p>
        <p><center><small><strong>So if we want to create a better world, the key is to set the data free.</strong></small></center></p>
       

        <h2 id="record-upload-share">Record, Upload, Share!</h2>
        <p>The individual is becoming a tiny chip inside a giant system that nobody really understands. <strong>Every day I absorb countless data</strong> bits through emails, phone calls and articles; process the data; and transmit back new bits through more emails, phone calls and articles. I don’t really know where I fit into the great scheme of things, and how my bits of data connect with the bits produced by billions of other humans and computers. I don’t have time to find out, because I am too busy answering all the emails. And as I process more data more efficiently – answering more emails, making more phone calls and writing more articles – so the people around me are flooded by even more data.</p>
        <p>This relentless flow of data sparks new inventions and disruptions that nobody plans, controls or comprehends. <q><em>Data religion now says that your every word and action is part of the great data flow, that the algorithms are constantly watching you and that they care about everything you do and feel.</em></q></p>
        <p><center>The new motto says:<br><q><strong>If you experience something – record it. If you record something – upload it. <br>If you upload something – share it</strong></q>.</center></p>
        <p>Throughout the Homodeus series we have repeatedly seen what makes humans superior to other animals. Dataism has a new and simple answer. In themselves, human experiences are not superior at all to the experiences of wolves or elephants. One bit of data is as good as another. However, a human can write a poem about his experience and post it online, thereby enriching the <strong>global dataprocessing system</strong>. That makes his bits count. A wolf cannot do this. Hence all of the wolf’s experiences – as deep and complex as they may be – are worthless. No wonder we are so busy converting our experiences into data. It isn’t a question of trendiness. It is a question of survival.</p> 
        <p>We must prove to ourselves and to the system that we still have value. And value lies not in having experiences, but in turning these experiences into free-flowing data.</p>

        <h2 id="know-thyself">Know Thyself</h2>
        <p>Dataism is neither <em>liberal</em> nor <em>humanist</em>. It should be emphasised, however, that Dataism isn’t anti-humanist. It has nothing against human experiences. It just doesn’t think they are intrinsically valuable.</p>
        <p>True, for the last 70,000 years or so, human experiences have been the most efficient data-processing algorithms in the universe, hence there was good reason to sanctify them.</p>
        <p>Today most Dataists say that the Internet-of-All-Things is sacred because humans are creating it to serve human needs. But eventually, the Internet-of-All-Things may become sacred in its own right. The shift from a <strong>homo-centric to a data-centric</strong> world view won’t be merely a philosophical revolution. It will be a practical revolution.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the Dataist idea that ‘organisms are algorithms’ is significant due to its day-to-day practical consequences.</p>
        <center><p><b>Ideas change the world only when they change our behaviour.</b></p></center> 
        <p>In contrast, when you listen to your feelings, you follow an algorithm that evolution has developed for millions of years, and that withstood the harshest quality tests of natural selection.</p>

        <h2 id="ripple-dataflow">A Ripple in the Dataflow</h2>
        <p>If Dataism succeeds in conquering the world, what will happen to us humans? In the beginning, it will probably accelerate the humanist pursuit of health, happiness and power. Dataism spreads itself by promising to fulfil these humanist aspirations. <em>Dataism thereby threatens to do to Homo sapiens what Homo sapiens has done to all other animals.</em></p>
        <p>If we think in terms of decades, then global warming, growing inequality and the disruption of the job market loom large. Yet if we take the really grand view of life, all other problems and developments are overshadowed by three interlinked processes: </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Science is converging on an all-encompassing dogma, which says that organisms are algorithms, and life is data processing.</li>
            <li>Intelligence is decoupling from consciousness.</li>
            <li>Non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms may soon know us better than we know ourselves. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>These three processes raise three key questions, which Yuval Noah Harari hopes will stick in your mind </p>
        <ul>
            <b>
            <li>Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?</li>
            <li>What’s more valuable – intelligence or consciousness? </li>
            <li>What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?</li>
            </b>
        </ul>
